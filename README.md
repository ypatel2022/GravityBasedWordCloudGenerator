# GravityBasedWordCloudGenerator

This project was made with Unity2D. The purpose was to make a word cloud generator using a method I have never seen before.

To use this generator, download the build. Currently, the only build available is for Windows 10. Next, open the folder and launch the Word Cloud Generator app. Now, copy your text you want to use and paste it into input field. Finally press generate, and watch gravity do it's job.

To customize or modify the project, download the Assets, Packages and ProjectSettings folders. Next, make a Unity2D Version 2019.4.13 project and drag the three folders over to replace the default ones. Now, you can launch the project and customize away!
